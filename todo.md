## Known Issues
- [ ] Real AudienceLab API integration not working in dev environment (CORS/tRPC client issues)
  - Backend proxy endpoint exists but frontend can't call it correctly
  - Currently using mock API as fallback for stable demo
  - Should work correctly when deployed to production (Vercel/Netlify with serverless functions)

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add more detailed error messages for API failures
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed enrichment requests
- [ ] Add ability to save/load field selection presets
- [ ] Add enrichment history/activity log
- [ ] Add data quality metrics and validation reports
- [ ] Add support for additional file formats (Excel, JSON)
- [ ] Add webhook notifications for completed enrichments
- [ ] Add team collaboration features (shared credits, user management)



## In Progress
- [x] Fix Vercel deployment build errors (package manager configuration)


- [x] Fix Vercel deployment showing source code instead of running app (create vercel.json)
